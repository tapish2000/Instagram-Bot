# Instagram-Bot

This is an automated bot which runs completely to reach the profile and extracts a list of followers and following, then by comparing, it outputs the usernames of those who don't follow you although you follow them.

## How to Run
- The file named insta_followers.py is the Instagram Bot.
- When you run it, it asks for your username and password, and if you have your account logged in through facebook or not.
- It takes a little bit time to complete, you can just leave it for sometime, but keep checking for any errors.
- Finally the browser closes and two files are created named followers.txt and following.txt
- Then run the find_traitor.py file, it will output the useernames of the people who are so called traitors, though not everyone, it also includes the meme pages or celebrities you follow, you can just ignore them and move onto find the ones who you also want to unfollow as they are not interested to follow you
